A stand-alone security review has been performed on the specification itself, however this example implementation is
offered as-is, and without any security guarantees. It will need an independent security review before it can be
considered ready for use in security-critical applications. If you integrate this code into your application it is
AT YOUR OWN RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY to arrange for an audit.
