Pedigree
========



This element is used to represent a pedigree to describe the family relationships of each sample along with their gender
and phenotype (affected status). PED files are typically used by software for genetic linkage analysis. The phenopacket
schema uses conventions similar to those of PED files to promote interoperability between existing PED files and PED
software, but does not actually store a PED file. See the detailed description at the `PLINK <http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/data.shtml>`_
website for more information about PED files.

The information in this element can be used by programs for analysis of a multi-sample VCF file with exome or genome
sequences of members of a family, some of whom are affected by a Mendelian disease.

The pedigree is simply a list of Person objects. These objects are meant to reflect the elements of
a PED file.

.. _rstaffectedstatus:

AffectedStatus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This element is an enumeration to

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Description

   MISSING, It is unknown if the individual has the affected phenotype
   UNAFFECTED, The individual does not show the affected phenotype of the proband
   AFFECTED, The individual has the affected phenotype of the proband

In a PED file, affected persons are encoded with "2", and unaffecteds by "1"
(a "0" is used if no information is available). Instead, Phenopackets uses an enumeration as shown in the table.
In a PED file, the sex of individuals is encoded as a "1" for females, "2" for males, and "0" for unknown. Phenopackets
uses :ref:`rstsex` instead.

The message is made up of a list of ``Person`` elements (the Person element is defined within the Pedigree element).
Each Person element is equivalent to one row of a PED file.

The family ID and the individual IDs may be made up of letters and digits, and the combination of
family and individual ID should uniquely identify each person represented in the PED file. The
parents of a person in the pedigree are shown with the corresponding individual IDs. Individuals whose parents are not
represented in the PED file are known as founders; their parents are represented by a zero ("0") in the
columns for mother and father. Finally, the sex and the affected (disease) status of the person are shown.

.. _pedigree_identifiers:

If a ``Phenopacket`` is used to represent any of the individuals listed in the ``Pedigree``, then it is essential that
the ``individual_id`` used in the pedigree matches the ``id`` of the ``subject`` of the ``Phenopacket``. It is allowable
for the ``Pedigree`` to have individuals that do not have an associated ``Phenopacket``. This is useful, for instance,
if the ``Pedigree`` is being used to store the affected/not affected status of family members being examined by exome or genome
sequencing. In this case (i.e. where there are no associated phenopackets for the ``Pedigree.individual_id``), it is
expected that the ``individual_id`` elements match the sample identifiers of the exome/genome file.

The Pedigree object  does not support reporting multiple phenotypes in one individual.
The phenotype represented by the affectation status is whether the disease is present or not.
If this is desired, then one would have to create full phenopackets for each individual in a family.
