Evidence

This element intends to represent the evidence for an assertion such as an observation of a :ref:`rstphenotypicfeature`.
We recommend the use of terms from the `Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO) <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/eco.owl>`_

     "id": "ECO:0006017",
     "label": "author statement from published clinical study used in manual assertion"
   },

evidence_code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For example, in order to describe the evidence for a phenotypic observation that is derived from a publication,
one might use
the ECO term *author statement from published clinical study used in manual assertion*
(`ECO:0006017 <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/eco/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FECO_0006017>`_)
and record a PubMed id in the reference field
(See :ref:`rstexternalreference`).


reference
~~~~~~~~~
An :ref:`rstexternalreference` is used to store a reference to the publication or other source
that supports the evidence. Not all types of evidence will have an external reference, and therefore
this field is optional.
