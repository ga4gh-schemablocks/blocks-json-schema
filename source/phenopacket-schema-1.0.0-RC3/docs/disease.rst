Disease

The word *phenotype* is used with many different meanings, including "the observable traits of an organism‚Äù. In medicine,
the word can be used with at least two different meanings. It is used to refer to
some **observed** deviation from normal morphology, physiology, or behavior. In contrast, the *disease* is a diagnosis,
i.e., and inference or hypothesis about the  cause underlying the observed phenotypic abnormalities. Occasionally,
physicians use the word phenotype to refer to a disease, but we do not use this meaning here.



**Data model**

.. csv-table::
   :header: Field, Type, Status, Description
   :align: left

   term, :ref:`rstontologyclass`, required, An ontology class that represents the disease
   onset, :ref:`rstage` or :ref:`rstagerange` or :ref:`rstontologyclass`, optional, an element representing the age of onset of the disease
   tumor_stage, :ref:`rstontologyclass`, optional, List of terms representing the tumor stage (TNM findings)



**Example**

.. code-block:: json

  {
  "term": {
    "id": "OMIM:164400",
    "label": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 "
    },
  "ageOfOnset": {
    "age": "P38Y7M"
    }
  }

See :ref:`rstcancerexample` for a usage of the Disease element that includes information about tumor staging.


term
~~~~


In the phenopacket schema, the disease element denotes the diagnosis by means of an ontology class. For rare
diseases, we recommend using a term from  `Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) <https://omim.org/>`_ (e.g.,
OMIM:101600), `Orphanet <https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/index.php>`_ (e.g., Orphanet:710), or
`MONDO <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo>`_ (e.g., MONDO:0007043). There are many other
ontologies and terminologies that can be used including `Disease Ontology <http://disease-ontology.org/>`_,
`SNOMED <http://www.snomed.org/>`_, and `ICD <https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/>`_.

tumor_stage
~~~~~~~~~~~
This element can be used if the phenopacket is described cancer. Tumor staging describes
the extent of growth of cancer. including the tumor and if applicable affected lymph nodes, and
distant metastases. See `staging <https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/staging>`_.
This element should be derived from child terms of NCIT:C48232 (Cancer TNM Finding) or equivalent.


age_of_onset
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``onset`` element provides three possibilities of describing the onset of the disease. It is also possible
to denote the onset of individual phenotypic features of disease in the Phenopacket element. If an ontology class
is used to refer to the age of onset of the disease, we recommend using a term from
`the HPO onset hierarchy <https://hpo.jax.org/app/browse/term/HP:0003674>`_.
