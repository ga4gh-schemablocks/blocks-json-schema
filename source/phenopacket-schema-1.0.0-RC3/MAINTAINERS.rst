Updating the specifications
---------------------------
Minor editorial fixes where there is no likelihood of controversy may be done directly on the master branch. Larger changes should be proposed as pull requests so that they can be discussed and refined. (Even those with write access to the repository should in general create their pull request branches within their own forks. This way when the main repository is forked again, the new fork is created with a minimum of extraneous volatile branches.)
