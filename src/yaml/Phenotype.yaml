title: Phenotype
description: |
  An individual phenotypic feature, observed as either present or absent (negated),
  with possible onset, modifiers and frequency.
  FHIR mapping: Condition (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/condition.html) or
  Observation (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html)
type: object
properties:
  description:
    description: |
      Free-text description of the phenotype. Note this is not a acceptable place to document/describe the
      phenotype - the type and onset etc... fields should be used for this purpose.
    type: string
    examples:
      - 'Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma'
  type:
    description: |
      The primary ontology class which describes the phenotype.
      FHIR mapping: Condition.identifier
    "$ref": https://schemablocks.org/OntologyClass/v0.0.1
    examples:
      - id: 'add example'
        label: 'Craniosynostosis'
  negated:
    description: |
      Flag to indicate whether the phenotype was observed or not. Default is 'false',
      in other words the phenotype was observed. Therefore it is only required in cases to indicate that
      the phenotype was looked for, but found to be absent. More formally, this modifier indicates
      the logical negation of the OntologyClass used in the 'type' field.
      *CAUTION* It is imperative to check this field for correct interpretation of the phenotype!
    type: boolean
    examples:
      - 'false'
  severity:
    description: |
      Severity of the condition e.g. subclasses of HP:0012824-Severity or SNOMED:272141005-Severities
