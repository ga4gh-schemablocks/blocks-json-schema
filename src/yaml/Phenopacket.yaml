title: Phenopacket
description: |
  An anonymous phenotypic description of an individual or biosample with potential genes of interest and/or diagnoses.
  This is a bundle of high-level concepts with no specifically defined relational concepts. It is expected that the
  resources sharing the phenopackets will define and enforce their own semantics and level of requirements for included
  fields.
