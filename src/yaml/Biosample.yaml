title: Biosample
description: |
  A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate
  molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular analyses (e.g.
  sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are extracted. Examples
  would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a culture for single cell genome
  sequencing or a protein fraction from a gradient centrifugation.
  Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g.
  genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same Biosample.
