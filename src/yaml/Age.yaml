          The age of the subject (e.g. individual at the onset of a phenotype),
          as Ontology_class. An example ontology here is HsapDv (Human
          Developmental Stages).
          This does not exactly correspond to the use of "age of onset" in HPO,
          since this specifically codes the "onset" of a phenotype, not just any
          age as a timepoint. So when coding onset, implementations may choose
          to either use an "age of onset" ontology or an "Age" class.
