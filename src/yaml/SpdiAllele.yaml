  A single SPDI allele.
  The SPDI notation uses four fields and is written out as four elements delimited by colons S:P:D:I, where
  S = SequenceId
  P = Position , a 0-based coordinate for where the Deleted Sequence starts
  D = DeletedSequence , sequence for the deletion, can be empty
  I = InsertedSequence , sequence for the insertion, can be empty
  The SPDI notation represents variation as deletion of a sequence (D) at a given position (P) in reference sequence (S)
  followed by insertion of a replacement sequence (I) at that same position. Position 0 indicates a deletion that
  starts immediately before the first nucleotide, and position 1 represents a deletion interval that starts between the
  first and second residues, and so on. Either the deleted or the inserted interval can be empty, resulting a pure
  insertion or deletion.
  The deleted and inserted sequences in SPDI are all written on the positive strand for two-stranded molecules.
