This repository is for __drafting__ schema blocks using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) and to develop an automated setup to convert the block code and inline documentation into Markdown, for readability and web representation. 

The plan is to start by converting existing GA4GH product models into schema blocks and use this for tuning formats and processes, before moving the resulting code and documentation to the main "blocks" repository and the [website](http://schemablocks.org/categories/schemas.html).

Code and documentation here have to be considered _DRAFTS_, not stable recommendations by the __{S}[B]__ community.
