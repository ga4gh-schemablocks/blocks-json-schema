title: Biosample
description: |
  A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate
    molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular analyses (e.g.
    sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are extracted.

    Examples would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a culture for single
    cell genome sequencing or a protein fraction from a gradient centrifugation.

    Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g.
    genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same Biosample.

    FHIR mapping: [Specimen](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/specimen.html).

        This is the pathologist’s diagnosis and may often represent a refinement of the clinical diagnosis given in the
