      Free-text description of the phenotype. Note this is not a acceptable place to document/describe the
      phenotype - the type and onset etc... fields should be used for this purpose.

      Flag to indicate whether the phenotype was observed or not. Default is 'false',
      in other words the phenotype was observed. Therefore it is only required in cases to indicate that
      the phenotype was looked for, but found to be absent. More formally, this modifier indicates
      the logical negation of the OntologyClass used in the 'type' field.
      *CAUTION* It is imperative to check this field for correct interpretation of the phenotype!

      - 'false'
