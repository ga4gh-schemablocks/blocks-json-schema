    description: |
      Individuals related in some way to the patient. For instance, the individuals may be genetically related or may
      be members of a cohort. If this field is used, then  it is expected that a pedigree will be included for
      genetically related individuals for use cases such as genomic diagnostics. If a phenopacket is being used to
      describe one member of a cohort, then in general one phenopacket will be created for each of the individuals in
      the cohort.
