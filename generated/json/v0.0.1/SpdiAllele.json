   "description" : "A single SPDI allele.\nThe SPDI notation uses four fields and is written out as four elements delimited by colons S:P:D:I, where\nS = SequenceId\nP = Position , a 0-based coordinate for where the Deleted Sequence starts\nD = DeletedSequence , sequence for the deletion, can be empty\nI = InsertedSequence , sequence for the insertion, can be empty\nThe SPDI notation represents variation as deletion of a sequence (D) at a given position (P) in reference sequence (S)\nfollowed by insertion of a replacement sequence (I) at that same position. Position 0 indicates a deletion that\nstarts immediately before the first nucleotide, and position 1 represents a deletion interval that starts between the\nfirst and second residues, and so on. Either the deleted or the inserted interval can be empty, resulting a pure\ninsertion or deletion.\nThe deleted and inserted sequences in SPDI are all written on the positive strand for two-stranded molecules.\nSee https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/notation/\n",
